## **Introduction**

Customer churn is a significant challenge for businesses across industries. This project aims to analyze customer data, identify patterns leading to churn.

---

## **Features and Dataset**

### **Dataset Description**
The project uses a dataset containing customer details and historical behaviors, such as demographics, service usage, and complaints. The dataset includes:  
- Customer ID  
- Tenure  
- Monthly charges and total charges  
- Contract type (monthly, yearly, etc.)  
- Payment method  
- Churn label (Yes/No)  

You can download the dataset [here](link-to-dataset-if-applicable).

### **Features**
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Summarizes trends and behaviors.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Predicts churn using machine learning algorithms.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhances dataset quality through techniques like scaling and encoding.

## **Project Workflow**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Insights into trends, patterns, and outliers.  
   - Visualizations of churn behavior.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values.  
   - Encoding categorical variables.  
   - Scaling numeric features.  

3. **Model Building**  
   - Comparing algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
   - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, and other metrics.  
   - Cross-validation to ensure robustness.

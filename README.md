## **Introduction**

Customer churn is a significant challenge for businesses across industries. This project aims to analyze customer data, identify patterns leading to churn.

---

## **Features and Dataset**

### **Dataset Description**
The project uses a dataset containing customer details and historical behaviors, such as demographics, service usage, and complaints. The dataset includes:  
- Customer ID  
- Tenure  
- Monthly charges and total charges  
- Contract type (monthly, yearly, etc.)  
- Payment method  
- Churn label (Yes/No)  

You can download the dataset [here]([link-to-dataset-if-applicable](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alinoranianesfahani/iranian-churn-dataset/data).

### **Features**
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Summarizes trends and behaviors.  
---

## **Project Workflow**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Insights into trends, patterns, and outliers.  
   - Visualizations of churn behavior.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values.  
   - Encoding categorical variables.  
   - Scaling numeric features.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, and other metrics.  
   - Cross-validation to ensure robustness.  

---

## **Modeling and Evaluation**

### **Algorithms Used**
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)  

### **Key Metrics**  
- **Accuracy**  
- **Precision & Recall**  
- **F1 Score**  
- **ROC-AUC Curve**

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation  
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization  
  - Scikit-learn, XGBoost for machine learning  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Power BI

## **How to Run the Project**

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammadibra40/Customer-Churn-Analysis.git
   cd Customer-Churn-Analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Follow the notebook steps for EDA, preprocessing, and modeling.

## **Results**

- **Insights**: Identified key factors influencing churn, such as contract type and tenure.  
- **Model Performance**: Achieved a ROC-AUC score of XX%, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities.  
- **Recommendations**:
Customized Retention Campaigns: Implement Targeted Retention Strategies for Each Customer Type
High-Value, Long-Standing, Highest Call Failure Rate (Cluster 0):
Prioritize network reliability and loyalty incentives because the call failure was too much for them to handle, and they are the highest users of SMSs, so promotions can be done in this area.

Low-Value, Low-Engagement, Low-Relationship (Cluster 1):
Lower call failures than the previous group but lower complaining rate, which means that they couldn't even bear the low call-failure.

Low-Value, Highest-Usage, Lowest in Subscription Length (Cluster 2):
Offer personalized plans and promotions to gain their interest on onboarding when they get subscription..
